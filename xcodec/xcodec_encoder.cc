/*
 * This takes a view of a data stream and turns it into a series of references
 * to other data, declarations of data to be referenced, and data that needs
 * escaped.
 *
 * The caller may request to retain a map of hashes and segments referenced by
 * this stream, a "refmap".
 *
 * Note that although each refmap is local to the frame referencing it, there
 * is still an issue with how hash reuse within even a single call to this
 * function could occur.  Consider the case of a memory cache limited to 2-3
 * segments.  When a colliding chunk of data is discovered, we will collide
 * within the refmap due to eviction.  The stream's decoding should be
 * decidable, but it is so only if we track an ordered listing of each
 * reference in order and the data it corresponds to and have some way of
 * identifying <ASK>/<LEARN> type requests linearly.  Another solution is
 * needed here, namely to just fail and fail tremendously when we have such
 * a malformed stream of data that we can't guarantee its decoding.  Or we
 * may just want to check the refmap in addition to the backing cache (and
 * maybe in preference to it) to prevent this problem.  But that shifts part
 * of the burden for correct decoding to the decoder, which then has to be
 * more careful about assuming that a <LEARN> covers all of the data it is
 * trying to decode which requests a hash, rather than just one frame.
